# Tic Tac Toe Game 🕹️

This is a simple **Tic Tac Toe** (X and O) game I made using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

It’s a 2-player game (played on the same computer), and it keeps track of the score for both players. It also detects draws and disables the board when the game ends.

## ✨ Features

- 3x3 Tic Tac Toe board
- Shows which player wins
- Detects draw if no one wins
- Keeps score of Player X and Player O
- "Reset" button to restart the current match
- "New Game" button to reset the board and both players’ scores

---

## 🔧 How It Works

- Click on any box to make your move.
- X goes first, then O.
- The game checks for a winning pattern after each move.
- If there's a winner, it shows the message and disables all boxes.
- If no winner and all 9 boxes are filled, it's a draw.
- Use "Reset" to play again with the same scores.
- Use "New Game" to start fresh (scores go back to 0).
